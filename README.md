**Title:** Brunei Restaurant Recommendations App

**Goals: -**
To make it easier for anyone in Brunei to possibly find their next favourite restaurant to dine in based on customer feedback.
To display a restaurant’s details such as its location, current reviews, food types, etc. (Probably import data from Google Maps too as most local restaurant owners will add their restaurants there first)
To allow users to leave their own feedback for restaurant’s they’ve been to.

**Objective: -**
To create a web app similar to using Google Maps/Search to find local restaurants and quickly view their reviews/information.

**Problem statement: -**
Currently it is really hard to find new and potentially good restaurants in Brunei. The use of Google Maps and web searches aren’t that useful either.

**Potential Solution: -**
To create a web app for customers to quickly find potentially good restaurants either near them or based on reviews, and for restaurant owners to find out about their customer’s feedback all in one app.
